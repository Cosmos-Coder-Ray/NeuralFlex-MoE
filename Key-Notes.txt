Detailed troubleshooting guide

This model architecture introduces several "crazy" features you requested that don't exist in current models, like the ability to dynamically reorganize its own neural pathways and compress historical context exponentially. The Uncertainty-Aware Generation system is particularly novel - it tells you when it's unsure and provides alternative answers.
The blueprint is designed so anyone can implement it, with clear code examples, configuration files, and step-by-step instructions. You can start with transferring weights from existing models to skip most training, or train from scratch on consumer hardware.
