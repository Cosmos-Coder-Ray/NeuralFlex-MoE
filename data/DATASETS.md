## 1. Core Language & Reasoning Datasets

These datasets form the foundation of the model's understanding of language, code, and reasoning.

| Dataset | Hugging Face ID | Description | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RedPajama-1T** | `togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T` | A 1.2 trillion token dataset created to replicate the LLaMA training dataset. Broad and diverse. | General Text |
| **The Stack v2** | `bigcode/the-stack-v2` | A massive 6.4 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 600+ languages. | Code |
| **Dolma** | `allenai/dolma` | A 3 trillion token dataset of diverse, high-quality text from web content, books, code, and papers. | General Text |
| **RefinedWeb** | `tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb` | A massive 5 trillion token dataset of high-quality, filtered web data. | General Text |
| **OpenHermes-2.5** | `teknium/OpenHermes-2.5` | A high-quality dataset of 1 million entries of primarily GPT-4 level instruction-following data. | Instructions |
| **GSM8K** | `gsm8k` | A dataset of 8.5K high-quality, linguistically diverse grade school math word problems. | Math Reasoning |
| **ARC Challenge** | `ai2_arc` | A challenging science question-answering dataset requiring deep reasoning. | Science Reasoning |

**Download Command Example:**
```bash
# Using huggingface_hub CLI
huggingface-cli download togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/RedPajama-Data-1T
```

## 2. "Any-to-Text" Multi-modal Datasets

These datasets are crucial for training the Cross-Modal Reasoning Bridge (CMRB) and enabling the model to understand image and audio inputs.

### Image-to-Text Datasets

| Dataset | Hugging Face ID | Description | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LAION-2B** | `laion/laion2B-en` | A massive dataset of 2 billion English image-text pairs. The foundation for many vision-language models. | Image Captioning |
| **COCO Captions** | `coco_captions` | A standard benchmark dataset with ~1.5 million captions for over 330K images. | Image Captioning |
| **TextCaps** | `textcaps` | A dataset with 1.4 million captions for 28K images, focused on reading text within images (OCR). | OCR & Vision |
| **Visual Genome** | `visual_genome` | A detailed dataset connecting objects, attributes, and relationships in images to language. | Scene Understanding |

**Download Command Example:**
```bash
# Using huggingface_hub CLI
huggingface-cli download laion/laion2B-en --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/laion2B-en
```

### Audio-to-Text Datasets

| Dataset | Hugging Face ID | Description | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Common Voice** | `mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0` | A massive, multi-language dataset of transcribed speech. Excellent for speech recognition. | Speech Recognition |
| **LibriSpeech** | `librispeech_asr` | A large corpus of read English speech, derived from audiobooks. A standard ASR benchmark. | Speech Recognition |
| **AudioCaps** | `tglcourse/audioset_small` | A dataset of ~50k audio clips from AudioSet, each with a human-written caption. | Audio Captioning |
| **Freesound (FSD50K)**| `fsd50k` | A dataset of over 50,000 audio clips of everyday sounds, with labels from a vocabulary of 200 classes. | Sound Classification |

**Download Command Example:**
```bash
# Using huggingface_hub CLI
huggingface-cli download mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0 --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./data/common_voice
```

## 3. Data Preparation

The `scripts/prepare_datasets.py` script will be implemented to handle the downloading, preprocessing, and tokenization of these datasets. It will include logic to:
- Stream data directly from Hugging Face where possible.
- Clean and filter low-quality samples.
- Convert audio to spectrograms.
- Tokenize text and prepare inputs for the model.
